# Visualizing Pure Qubit States on the Bloch Sphere Using Plotly

The Bloch sphere is an effective way of conveying a qubit's state visually. Every unique qubit state can be expressed as a point on the sphere, and that point can visually express the superposition and phase of the qubit.

In this project, I seek to reinforce my understanding of density matrices and qubits while also creating a tool that I can use to visualize qubits during my research.
